Bachelor Thesis Project

The application uses BLoC pattern which consists of 3 layers:
1. Presentation layer
2. Business logic layer
3. Repository layer

Layers are separated by feature and are located in **view**, **repository** and **bloc** folders of each feature respectively.

Repositories make use of data models which are generated by using GraphQL schema definition.
